# Data_Engineering

Step-By-Step Data Engineering on a small Data Source to get valuable information out of data.

Step 1: Select a source of data - Informational blog/ resource for other resources.
Step 2: Scrape data from Step 1, use best practises and ingest data to the cloud system.
Step 3: Apply modelling on the data, learn from outputs and reapply on other sources to get valued results.
Step 4: Analysis of the results. 
Step 5: Model evaluations of accuracy, recall and application.
Step 6: Reinforced learning on the results. 
Step 7: Optimizations and validations.
Step 8: Deliverables.
